           As the ethereal embrace of impending demise enveloped you, 
  a flicker of recollection ignited within the recesses of your consciousness, 
            an ember of memory that burgeoned into a radiant blaze. 
                  In that fleeting moment of transcendence, 
                     you are filled with DETERMINATION,
suddenly the tendrils of weakness that sought to pull you into the abyss recoiled, 
              vanquished by the resurgence of newfound strength, 
  as if the very essence of remembrance breathed life back into your weary soul.
